          <p>
            You can get a Git project using two main approaches. The first takes
            an existing project or directory and imports it into Git. The second
            clones an existing Git repository from another server.
          </p>
          <h1>Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory</h1>
          <p>
            If you’re starting to track an existing project in Git, you need to
            go to the project’s directory and type
          </p>
          <br />
          <code>$ git init</code>
          <br />
          <p>
            This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your
            necessary repository files — a Git repository skeleton. At this
            point, nothing in your project is tracked yet. (See Chapter 9 for
            more information about exactly what files are contained in the .git
            directory you just created.)
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed
            to an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those
            files and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few
            git add commands that specify the files you want to track, followed
            by a commit:
          </p>
          <br />
          <code
            >$ git add *.c $ git add README $ git commit -m 'initial project
            version'</code
          >
          <br />
          <p>
            We’ll go over what these commands do in just a minute. At this
            point, you have a Git repository with tracked files and an initial
            commit.
          </p>
          <h1>Cloning an Existing Repository</h1>
          <p>
            If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository — for
            example, a project you’d like to contribute to — the command you
            need is git clone. If you’re familiar with other VCS systems such as
            Subversion, you’ll notice that the command is clone and not
            checkout. This is an important distinction — Git receives a copy of
            nearly all data that the server has. Every version of every file for
            the history of the project is pulled down when you run git clone. In
            fact, if your server disk gets corrupted, you can use any of the
            clones on any client to set the server back to the state it was in
            when it was cloned (you may lose some server-side hooks and such,
            but all the versioned data would be there — see Chapter 4 for more
            details).
          </p>

          <p>
            You clone a repository with git clone [url]. For example, if you
            want to clone the Ruby Git library called Grit, you can do so like
            this:
          </p>
          <br />
          <code>$ git clone git://github.com/schacon/grit.git</code>
          <br />
          <p>
            That creates a directory named grit, initializes a .git directory
            inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks
            out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new
            grit directory, you’ll see the project files in there, ready to be
            worked on or used. If you want to clone the repository into a
            directory named something other than grit, you can specify that as
            the next command-line option:
          </p>
          <br />
          <code>$ git clone git://github.com/schacon/grit.git mygrit</code>
          <br />
          <p>
            That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target
            directory is called mygrit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. The
            previous example uses the git:// protocol, but you may also see
            http(s):// or user@server:/path.git, which uses the SSH transfer
            protocol. Chapter 4 will introduce all of the available options the
            server can set up to access your Git repository and the pros and
            cons of each.

          <header class="custom-font-header">Recording Changes</header>
          <p>
            You have a bona fide Git repository and a checkout or working copy
            of the files for that project. You need to make some changes and
            commit snapshots of those changes into your repository each time the
            project reaches a state you want to record.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of
            two states: tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files that were
            in the last snapshot; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged.
            Untracked files are everything else — any files in your working
            directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your
            staging area. When you first clone a repository, all of your files
            will be tracked and unmodified because you just checked them out and
            haven’t edited anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you’ve changed
            them since your last commit. You stage these modified files and then
            commit all your staged changes, and the cycle repeats. This
            lifecycle is illustrated in Figure 2-1.
          </p>

          <h1>Checking the Status of Your Files</h1>

          <p>
            The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is
            the git status command. If you run this command directly after a
            clone, you should see something like this:
          </p>
          <br />
          <code
            >$ git status <br />On branch master<br />
            nothing to commit, working directory clean</code
          >
          <br />
          <p>
            This means you have a clean working directory — in other words, no
            tracked files are modified. Git also doesn’t see any untracked
            files, or they would be listed here. Finally, the command tells you
            which branch you’re on. For now, that is always master, which is the
            default; you won’t worry about it here. The next chapter will go
            over branches and references in detail.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let’s say you add a new file to your project, a simple README file.
            If the file didn’t exist before, and you run git status, you see
            your untracked file like so:
          </p>
          <br />
          <code
            >$ vim README<br />
            $ git status<br />
            On branch master<br />
            Untracked files:<br />
            (use "git add &ltfile&gt..." to include in what will be
            committed)<br />
            <br />
            README
            <br />
            nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add"
            to track)</code
          >
          <br />

          <p>
            You can see that your new README file is untracked, because it’s
            under the “Untracked files” heading in your status output. Untracked
            basically means that Git sees a file you didn’t have in the previous
            snapshot (commit); Git won’t start including it in your commit
            snapshots until you explicitly tell it to do so. It does this so you
            don’t accidentally begin including generated binary files or other
            files that you did not mean to include. You do want to start
            including README, so let’s start tracking the file.

          <p>
            After you have created several commits, or if you have cloned a
            repository with an existing commit history, you’ll probably want to
            look back to see what has happened. The most basic and powerful tool
            to do this is the git log command.
          </p>
          <p>
            These examples use a very simple project called simplegit that I
            often use for demonstrations. To get the project, run
          </p>
          <br />
          <code>git clone git://github.com/schacon/simplegit-progit.git</code>
          <br />
          <p>
            When you run git log in this project, you should get output that
            looks something like this:

            By default, with no arguments, git log lists the commits made in
            that repository in reverse chronological order. That is, the most
            recent commits show up first. As you can see, this command lists
            each commit with its SHA-1 checksum, the author’s name and e-mail,
            the date written, and the commit message.
          </p>
          <p>
            A huge number and variety of options to the git log command are
            available to show you exactly what you’re looking for. Here, we’ll
            show you some of the most-used options.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the more helpful options is -p, which shows the diff
            introduced in each commit. You can also use -2, which limits the
            output to only the last two entries:

          <p>
            To be able to collaborate on any Git project, you need to know how
            to manage your remote repositories. Remote repositories are versions
            of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network
            somewhere. You can have several of them, each of which generally is
            either read-only or read/write for you. Collaborating with others
            involves managing these remote repositories and pushing and pulling
            data to and from them when you need to share work. Managing remote
            repositories includes knowing how to add remote repositories, remove
            remotes that are no longer valid, manage various remote branches and
            define them as being tracked or not, and more. In this section,
            we’ll cover these remote-management skills.
          </p>
          <h1>Showing Your Remotes</h1>
          <p>
            To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the git
            remote command. It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you’ve
            specified. If you’ve cloned your repository, you should at least see
            origin — that is the default name Git gives to the server you cloned
            from:
          </p>
          <br />

            You can also specify -v, which shows you the URL that Git has stored
            for the shortname to be expanded to:
          </p>
          <br />
          <code
            >$ git remote -v<br />
            origin git://github.com/schacon/ticgit.git (fetch)<br />
            origin git://github.com/schacon/ticgit.git (push)</code
          >
          <br />
          <p>
            If you have more than one remote, the command lists them all. For
            example, my Grit repository looks something like this.
          </p>
          <br />
          <code
            >$ cd grit<br />
            $ git remote -v<br />
            bakkdoor git://github.com/bakkdoor/grit.git<br />
            cho45 git://github.com/cho45/grit.git<br />
            defunkt git://github.com/defunkt/grit.git<br />
            koke git://github.com/koke/grit.git<br />
            origin git@github.com:mojombo/grit.git</code
          >
          <br />
          <p>
            This means I can pull contributions from any of these users pretty
            easily. But notice that only the origin remote is an SSH URL, so
            it’s the only one I can push to (we’ll cover why this is in Chapter
            4).

          <p>
            Like most VCSs, Git has the ability to tag specific points in
            history as being important. Generally, people use this functionality
            to mark release points (v1.0, and so on). In this section, you’ll
            learn how to list the available tags, how to create new tags, and
            what the different types of tags are.
          </p>
          <h1>Listing Your Tags</h1>
          <p>
            Listing the available tags in Git is straightforward. Just type git
            tag:
          </p>
          <br />
          <code>$ git tag v0.1 v1.3</code>
          <br />
          <p>
            This command lists the tags in alphabetical order; the order in
            which they appear has no real importance.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also search for tags with a particular pattern. The Git
            source repo, for instance, contains more than 240 tags. If you’re
            only interested in looking at the 1.4.2 series, you can run this:
          </p>
          <br />
          <code
            >$ git tag -l 'v1.4.2.*' v1.4.2.1 v1.4.2.2 v1.4.2.3 v1.4.2.4
          </code>
          <br />
          <h1>Creating Tags</h1>
          <p>
            Git uses two main types of tags: lightweight and annotated. A
            lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn’t change —
            it’s just a pointer to a specific commit. Annotated tags, however,
            are stored as full objects in the Git database. They’re checksummed;
            contain the tagger name, e-mail, and date; have a tagging message;
            and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG). It’s
            generally recommended that you create annotated tags so you can have
            all this information; but if you want a temporary tag or for some
            reason don’t want to keep the other information, lightweight tags
            are available too.
